# PassShield

This documentation provides a description of a desktop application called PassShield, which allows users to store their passwords in an encrypted file format. In the era of digitization, when users sign up and log into multiple online services daily, managing multiple passwords becomes extremely challenging. Remembering strong and unique passwords for each service is difficult, and using the same password for multiple sites creates serious security risks.
